{"name":"LMo5 App. A: Magic Items","content":"<div class=\"w-100 h-100 overflow-x-hidden\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"422\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Appendix A: Magic Items</span></span> <p>A magic item is a wondrous treasure that adventurers find in a monster's hoard, in a trap-riddled dungeon, or in the possession of a slain foe. Every adventure holds the promise—but not a guarantee—of finding one or more magic items, and part of the fun of exploring a dungeon is the thrill of unearthing an item found nowhere else.</p><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"423\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Using a Magic Item</span></span> <p>A magic item's description explains how the item works. Handling a magic item is enough to give a character a sense that something is extraordinary about the item. Casting the @Item[2njrfTRo3qohrRjQ]{identify} spell on the item then reveals its properties. Alternatively, a character can concentrate on the item during a short rest, while being in physical contact with the item. At the end of the rest, the character learns the item's properties. Potions are an exception; a little taste is enough to tell the taster what the potion does.</p><p>Certain magic items require a user to <b>attune</b> to them before their magical properties can be used. Attuning to a magic item requires that you spend a short rest concentrating on it (this can't be the same short rest used to learn an item's properties). Depending on the nature of the item, this concentration can take the form of prayers, weapon practice, or meditation. In any case, the concentration period must be uninterrupted. Once you are attuned to an item, you can use its magical properties.</p><p>An item can be attuned to only one creature at a time. A creature can be attuned to no more than three magic items at any given time, and you can attune yourself to only one item during a short rest.</p><p>Your attunement to an item ends when the item has been more than 100 feet away from you for 24 hours and when you die. You can also voluntarily end your attunement to an item with another short rest.</p></div><hr class=\"rd__hr rd__hr--section\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"424\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Item Descriptions</span></span> <div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"425\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">+1 Armor</span></span> <p>The most basic form of magic armor is a superb product of physical and magical craft.

{"name":"LMo2 Part 2 — Phandalin","content":"<div class=\"w-100 h-100 overflow-x-hidden\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"152\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Phandalin</span></span> <p>The frontier town of Phandalin is built on the ruins of a much older settlement. Hundreds of years ago, the old Phandalin was a thriving human town whose people were firmly allied with the dwarves and gnomes of the Phandelver's Pact. However, the same orc horde that sacked the mines at Wave Echo Cave laid waste to the settlement, and Phandalin was abandoned for centuries.</p><p>In the last three or four years, hardy settlers from the cities of Neverwinter and Waterdeep have begun the hard work of reclaiming the ruins of Phandalin. A bustling frontier settlement has grown up on the site of the old town, and is home now to farmers, woodcutters, fur traders, and prospectors drawn by stories of gold and platinum in the foothills of the Sword Mountains. Unfortunately, more than a few bandits and brigands have settled here as well, taking advantage of the fact that the area has no local lord or authority to chase them off. A gang known as the Redbrands has controlled Phandalin for the past two months, extorting and bullying everyone in town. The gang is led by a mysterious figure known to the townsfolk as Glasstaff.</p><p>When the characters first arrive in Phandalin, read:</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><p>The rutted track emerges from a wooded hillside, and you catch your first glimpse of Phandalin. The town consists of forty or fifty simple log buildings, some built on old fieldstone foundations. More old ruins-crumbling stone walls covered in ivy and briars-surround the newer houses and shops, showing how this must have been a much larger town in centuries past. Most of the newer buildings are set on the sides of the cart track, which widens into a muddy main street of sorts as it climbs toward a ruined manor house on a hillside at the east side of town.</p><p>As you approach, you see children playing on the town green and townsfolk tending to chores or running errands at shops. Many people look up as you approach, but all return to their business as you go by.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>If Sildar Hallwinter is with the party, add:</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><p>Sildar seems much more at ease.</p><p>\"My friends,\" he says, \"let us secure lodgings. I'm told the local inn is very quaint.\"</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>Sildar's plan is to get some rest at the Stonehill Inn, then search Phandalin for signs of the missing wizard, Iarno Albrek. When his investigation hits a dead end, he sets up a meeting with Townmaster Harbin Wester (see the \"Townmaster's Hall\" section).</p><p>During this part of the adventure, the characters can visit the various locations in Phandalin and talk to the NPCs there. (See the \"Town Description\" section for details.) The town is small enough that it takes only a few minutes to stroll from one end to the other. However, the characters arrive late in the day and can't get to more than one or two locations before it's time to seek lodgings for the night.</p><p>Some locales the characters should visit include the following:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \"><b>Barthen's Provisions.</b> If the characters have the wagonload of supplies from the \"Meet Me in Phandalin\" adventure hook, they are meant to deliver it to this shop.</li><li class=\"rd__li \"><b>Lionshield Coster.</b> If the characters retrieved the stolen goods from the Cragmaw hideout, they might want to return them to the rightful owner.</li><li class=\"rd__li \"><b>Stonehill Inn.</b> If the characters have Sildar Hallwinter with them, the knight suggests heading for this inn to find lodgings. If the characters are otherwise looking for a place to eat and sleep, they discover that the Stonehill appears to be the best available option.</li></ul><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"153\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Encounters in Phandalin</span></span> <p>When the characters explore Phandalin, you don't need to keep track of how much time is spent at each location. Instead, imagine that you're directing an old-style western movie. Your goal is to present several scenes in which the adventurers walk into a store or saloon and meet the people there. By interacting with these NPCs, the adventurers learn what the NPCs need or what information they want to share, then can move on to the next location. These scenes are a series of roleplaying encounters that take place over the course of a couple of days of game time.</p><p>To begin, ask the players where they want to go and what they want to do in town. For example, you could tell them, \"There's an inn, a town hall, a shrine, general stores and trading posts, and a few other homes and businesses. Where do you want to go?\" When the players pick a spot, refer to the description in the following section, introduce the NPCs there, and let the interaction begin.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"154\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Stonehill Inn</span></span> <p>If the players aren't sure what their characters should do, encourage them to begin at the Stonehill Inn. The NPCs there are \"pointers\" who can direct the characters toward the various adventure opportunities and important rumors that can be found in other parts of the town. By visiting the inn, the characters learn what other places they should visit.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"155\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Redbrand Ruffians</span></span> <p>Sooner or later, the adventurers run into the thugs who run Phandalin. All you need to do is choose when the ruffians appear. After the characters have had a chance to visit several locations in town and talk to the townsfolk, they might decide to go looking for the Redbrands. When they do, run the \"Redbrand Ruffians\" encounter. Alternatively, if the characters are reluctant to seek out the ruffians, the Redbrands can come looking for them at a time of your choosing.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"156\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Finding Cragmaw Castle</span></span> <p>The characters might want to seek out Cragmaw Castle to find and rescue Gundren Rockseeker. Most of the townsfolk are preoccupied with the Redbrands, and no one in town knows the location of Cragmaw Castle. Qelline Alderleaf, Sildar Hallwinter, and Halia Thornton can offer suggestions on how the party might find someone who knows the location.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"157\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Important NPCs</span></span> <p>Here is a quick summary of the most important NPCs in Phandalin, and their relevance to the adventure.</p><table class=\"rd__table  \"><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-2 bold\">Toblen Stonehill</td><td class=\"col-10\">Innkeeper.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 bold\">Elmar Barthen</td><td class=\"col-10\">Owns a trading post - owes money to the party if you are using the \"Meet Me in Phandalin\" adventure hook.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 bold\">Daran Edermath</td><td class=\"col-10\">Member of the Order of the Gauntlet with a quest for the party.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 bold\">Linene Graywind</td><td class=\"col-10\">Runs a trading post and offers a reward for retrieving her supplies.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 bold\">Halia Thornton</td><td class=\"col-10\">Member of the Zhentarim with a quest for the party.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 bold\">Qelline Alderleaf</td><td class=\"col-10\">Helpful halfling farmer whose son, Carp, knows a secret way into the Redbrands' hideout.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 bold\">Sister Garaele</td><td class=\"col-10\">Elf cleric of Tymora and Harper agent with a quest for the party.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 bold\">Harbin Wester</td><td class=\"col-10\">Townmaster of Phandalin with a quest for the party.</td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 bold\">Sildar Hallwinter</td><td class=\"col-10\">Sildar Hallwinter is a retired soldier and sellsword who hails from the city of Neverwinter.

You don't need to be an actor or stand-up comedian to get good drama or humor out of your NPCs, but if you want to ham it up, here's some advice:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \"><b>Relax.</b> Don't worry about impressing your players with your thespian skills (or lack thereof).</li><li class=\"rd__li \"><b>Get inside the NPCs' minds.</b> Imagine how they might react to the characters, and strive to be realistic.</li><li class=\"rd__li \"><b>Mug it up.</b> Scowl, smile, snarl, flutter your eyelashes, pout, cross your eyes, rub your hands together-what-ever it takes to make your NPCs come to life.</li><li class=\"rd__li \"><b>Try different voices.</b> Borrow distinctive speech patterns from real life, movies, and television. Adjust the volume as appropriate. An NPC can be loud, soft-spoken, or something in between.</li><li class=\"rd__li \"><b>Keep the game moving.</b> Let the players steer the interactions with the NPCs.</li></ul><p>The characters have no reason to fight ordinary townsfolk. Hence, no game statistics are provided for them. If statistics become necessary, use the commoner stat block to represent an adult NPC of any race.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"159\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Town Description</span></span> <p>Phandalin is small, so the characters can visit multiple locations and NPCs throughout a given day. If the players choose to have their characters split up, they can cover more ground, but you'll have to take turns running each interaction for each player.

(The characters' other alternative for lodging is to camp outside the town, or to persuade a farmer such as Doran Edermath or Qelline Alderleaf to let them sleep in a hayloft.)</p><p>The proprietor is a short, friendly young human male named Toblen Stonehill. Toblen is a native of the town of Triboar to the east. He came to Phandalin to prospect, but soon realized that he knew a lot more about running an inn than he did about mining. The new town offered a good opportunity to become established. Toblen is upset that the Redbrands have been allowed to terrorize the town, and that Harbin Wester, the townmaster, has done nothing to curtail them. However, he tries not to stir up trouble for fear that the Redbrands might retaliate against his wife and children.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"161\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Rumors</span></span> <p>Spending a little time in the common room and chatting up the townspeople can provide the characters with a number of good leads to explore in and around town.

Its shelves stock most ordinary goods and supplies, including backpacks, bedrolls, rope, and rations. The place is open from sunup to sundown. Barthen's does not stock weapons or armor, but characters can purchase other adventuring gear here, with the exception of items that cost more than 25 gp. (For prices, see \"Adventuring Gear\" in the rulebook.) Characters in need of weapons or armor are directed to the Lionshield Coster (see that section).</p><p>The proprietor is Elmar Barthen, a lean and balding human male shopkeeper of fifty years with a kindly manner.

Barthen pays the agreed amount (10 gp to each character) and takes possession of the wagon and its supplies. If the characters tell him of Gundren Rockseeker's capture, Barthen is saddened by the news and encourages the party to find and rescue the dwarf. He considers Gundren a friend and was excited by talk of discovering the lost mine of the Phandelver's Pact in the nearby hills. If the party hasn't already learned details of the mine from Sildar Hallwinter, a character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check can relate the information from the first two paragraphs of the \"Background\" section at the start of the adventure.</p></div><p>Barthen also mentions that two more Rockseeker brothers, Nundro and Tharden, are camped somewhere outside town.

A fit, silver-haired half-elf well over a hundred years old, Daran is a fighter who served as a marshal and herald for many years in the lands of the Dragon Coast, far to the southeast. Upon retiring, he returned to the Neverwinter region, his original home.</p><p>Daran is a member of the Order of the Gauntlet, a devout and vigilant group that seeks to protect others from the depredations of evildoers. The order is always vigilant, ready to smite evil, enforce justice, and enact retribution against any who try to subjugate or harm others.

More disturbingly, several prospectors have reported being chased from the area by undead. He asks the characters to visit the ruins, a couple days march northeast of Phandalin, and find out who's there and what they're up to.

(For prices, see \"Adventuring Gear\" in the rulebook.) Linene has a few scruples, however, and won't sell weapons to anyone she thinks might be a threat to the town.

In the absence of any local lord or authority, the exchange also serves as an unofficial records office, registering claims to various streams and excavations around the area. There isn't any real gold rush in Phandalin, but enough wealth is hidden in the nearby streams and valleys to support a good number of independent prospectors.</p><p>The exchange is a great place to meet people who spend a lot of time out and about in the countryside surrounding Phandalin. The guildmaster is an ambitious and calculating human woman named Halia Thornton. In her attempts to establish the Miner's Exchange as the closest thing the town has to a governing authority, she acts as more than a simple merchant. She is also an agent of the Zhentarim, a powerful organization that seeks to exert secret control over the North through wealth and influence. Halia is working slowly to bring Phandalin under her control, and can become a valuable patron to the characters if they don't cross her.</p><p>Halia doesn't know the location of Cragmaw Castle, but she has heard that the Redbrands have a goblin minion serving them.

That night, the gang returned and abducted the family from their home in Phandalin. The gang plans to sell the family into slavery.</p><p>The Dendrars are grateful to the characters for rescuing them, but they can't provide much information about the Redbrand hideout.

Several barrels are stored against the walls here, along with a number of empty crates, straw for packing, hammers, pry bars, and nails.</p><p>The cavern continues for some distance to the south. You can make out several passages that open up off the larger cavern, and what looks like a deep pit or crevasse in the floor.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>This room contains two secret doors, one leading to area 6 and the other to area 12.

Crevasse</span></span> <p>The characters arrive here by one of three routes: the tunnel from area 1, the storeroom at area 7, or the roughhewn passage to the south, which continues off the map for about one hundred feet and emerges from a tunnel in the woods south of Tresendar Manor. The passage is an excellent way to smuggle people or goods in and out of Phandalin without being seen, and is thus perfect for a gang of slavers and thieves.</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><p>A cold breeze fills this large natural cavern, carrying with it the faint scent of decaying flesh. A crevasse divides the cavern and is flanked by two rough stone columns that support the twenty-foot-high ceiling. Two arched wooden bridges span the chasm.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>The guardian of this cave is a @Actor[xgHAumiQhWx3HeQu]{nothic}, an insane subterranean monster that hungers for flesh. The creature, lured by a faint magical effect emanating from the crevasse, was occupying the area when the Redbrands moved in. Iarno managed to strike a bargain with the monster, convincing it to help guard the stronghold in exchange for treasure and the occasional gift of fresh meat. Still, the nothic is untrustworthy.</p><p>The nothic lurks near the west ends of the two bridges. If it notices intruders entering the cave, it hides behind one of the large stone columns and watches them, attempting to use its Weird Insight (see the creature's stat block) to discern the characters' secrets.</p><p>The nothic communicates using telepathy. If detected, it prefers to negotiate and isn't above betraying the Redbrands for the right incentive, such as the promise of food. When roleplaying the nothic, consider speaking in whispers and throwing in some mad cackles and bits of gibberish. Also be sure to mention that the creature isn't actually talking but rather filling the characters' heads with its foul murmurings and demands for food. The nothic knows everything the Redbrands know; see the \"What the Redbrands Know\" sidebar on page 20.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"227\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Bridges</span></span> <p>These bridges are made of wooden planks and have no rails. The south one is rigged to collapse when a creature weighing more than 50 pounds moves across it. A character next to the bridge can discern that the construction is faulty with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Any creature can use an action to dislodge one end of either bridge, dropping it into the crevasse.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"228\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Crevasse</span></span> <p>This steep-sided fissure is 5 to 10 feet wide and 20 feet deep. Its rough walls are easily climbed without an ability check. A creature that falls into the crevasse takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and lands prone in a jumble of rubble that is difficult terrain (see \"Difficult Terrain\" in the rulebook).</p></div><p>The bottom of the crevasse feels unnaturally cold. When viewed with a @Item[5fui1RaHT1TYTAA7]{detect magic} spell, the area emanates a faint necromantic aura. The magic causes all organic matter in the crevasse to age and decompose at half the normal rate.</p><p>Currently heaped at the bottom among broken and well-gnawed bones is the half-eaten body of Thel Dendrar, the woodcarver of Phandalin who was murdered by the Redbrands. The outlaws left his corpse here for the nothic to feed on.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"229\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Treasure</span></span> <p>The nothic keeps its hoard in a battered wooden chest hidden in a cubbyhole at the bottom of the crevasse, under the north bridge. The chest can't be seen from the edge of the crevasse, but is obvious to any character who descends into the fissure. The chest contains 160 sp, 120 gp, five malachite gems (15 gp each), two potions of healing, and a scroll of augury.</p><p>The chest also holds a +1 longsword in a silver-chased scabbard. The sword is inscribed with the name \"Talon,\" and its hilt is worked in the shape of a bird of prey with outspread wings. It once belonged to a great knight named Aldith Tresendar, known as the Black Hawk. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check recognizes the sword and recalls this lore.</p><p>Sir Aldith died fighting off the orcs that attacked through the hidden caverns below his manor.

Guard Barracks</span></span> <p>A character who listens at this door with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check hears several gruff voices issuing demeaning commands in the Goblin tongue. Examples include \"Lick the floor!\" and \"Roll like a dog!\" The bugbears here are bullying their goblin slave.</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><p>This barracks contains four roughly built wooden bunks, with heaped-up blankets and dirty dishes scattered about. A strong smell of unwashed bodies and rotten meat fills the air. Three tall, furry humanoids are lounging among the mess, barking orders at a sad little goblin that demeans itself for their amusement. Your sudden appearance causes the goblin to faint.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>Three @Actor[RMgVVdcOBDTOuje3]{bugbears} and one @Actor[Ff1ALgTHwip0EOzr]{goblin} are present. The goblin, Droop, falls unconscious at the sight of the party, but another creature can use an action to wake him. Otherwise, Droop remains unconscious for 1d10 minutes.</p><p>The bugbears work for the Black Spider and were sent here to help Iarno keep the Redbrands and the citizens of Phandalin in line. The leader is named Mosk. He wears a jeweled eye patch even though he has both his eyes. Mosk wears the eye patch because he thinks it's fancy.</p><p>The bugbears avoid the human members of the Redbrands. If the characters are wearing scarlet cloaks taken from elsewhere, the bugbears assume that they serve Iarno. Clever characters might even persuade the bugbears to help deal with \"traitors\" or \"impostors\" elsewhere in the dungeon. If you don't think the players are doing a great job roleplaying the deception, you can have the character who is doing most of the talking make a DC 15 Charisma (Deception) check to convince the bugbears to do what the party wants.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"232\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Role Playing Droop</span></span> <p>The goblin, Droop, is not a threat to the party. He has been cowed by the bugbears and follows their orders until someone stronger comes along.</p><p>If he regains consciousness during combat, Droop hides and avoids the fight. He is such a coward that if he is ordered to fight, he does so with disadvantage (as explained in the rulebook).</p><p>Droop knows the general layout of the Redbrand hideout, as well as the location of its secret doors and traps. He doesn't think to offer up the information, but if prompted, he reveals as much as he can remember in an attempt to be useful to the party. Some of the details might be confusing or mixed up. He is a goblin, after all.</p><p>If the bugbears are dispatched, Droop tries to ingratiate himself with the party. He doesn't remember the route to Cragmaw Castle, but he knows it's up north, in the forest. He also knows that Cragmaw goblins patrol around Phandalin, and he suggests the characters might be able to capture a patrol to learn more about the castle.</p><p>Characters might be inclined to keep Droop around for a while.

When there is no official business to discuss, it doubles as a common room where the stronghold guards can relax while off duty.</p><p>A character who listens at the door with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check hears the villains within engaged in a game of knucklebones. This makes for a mysterious rattling sound, followed by shouts and groans and a sudden gabble of voices as wagers are paid. If the characters burst into the room, they automatically surprise its occupants.</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><p>Several worn tables and chairs are scattered around this large room. Wooden benches are drawn up against walls decorated with draperies of brown and red, and several ale kegs are propped up and tapped.</p><p>Four tough-looking human warriors wearing scarlet cloaks are gathered around one of the tables. A stack of coins and trinkets is heaped upon the tabletop between them.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>Four @Actor[A3mlAhq8kMCx1B50]{Redbrand ruffians} are drinking and playing knucklebones when the characters enter.

Beneath his genteel demeanor, however, Iarno is just as thuggish and arrogant as any Redbrand outlaws.</p><p>If threatened, Iarno uses his @Item[w3cInssneC9tw0Gc]{staff of defense} to cast @Item[CoMQqiRBf13RneZH]{mage armor} on himself. He then casts offensive spells at enemies he can see. Iarno's stat block contains a list of the spells he has prepared. For descriptions of those spells and their effects, see the rulebook. Iarno uses the shield power of his staff for added protection.</p><p>If he is reduced to 8 or fewer hit points and has no avenues of escape, Iarno surrenders. He values his life more than anything, and he remains a model prisoner in the hopes that the Black Spider will somehow learn of his predicament and \"arrange for his freedom.\"</p><p>If he is questioned while in captivity, Iarno relates the following information, all of which is true:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">The Black Spider is a drow (dark elf).</li><li class=\"rd__li \">The Black Spider sent four bugbears to help Iarno keep the population of Phandalin under control, but the Redbrands have managed without them.

The rich mine of the Phandelver's Pact was lost five hundred years ago during orc invasions that devastated this part of the North.</p><p>In the centuries since, countless prospectors and adventurers have searched for the lost mine, but none succeeded until the Rockseeker brothers found the entrance a month ago. Unfortunately, the Rockseekers did not realize they were being trailed by spies working for Nezznar, the Black Spider, and they inadvertently led the drow villain to their prize. Nezznar and his followers dealt with the two Rockseekers who were guarding their find, then arranged for Gundren's ambush. Learning of the adventurers' involvement with Gundren or their exploits in and around Phandalin, the Black Spider has given orders for the characters to be dealt with. Meanwhile, Nezznar has begun his exploration of Wave Echo Cave.</p><p>The drow is searching for the Forge of Spells, where the human mages of old Phandalin enchanted dwarven weapons and gnome gadgets. However, Nezznar's exploration has been hindered by the restless undead and dangerous monsters that lurk in Wave Echo Cave, forcing him to proceed with great caution.</p><p>The adventurers now have the chance to aid Gundren, avenge his kin, and put a stop to the nefarious schemes of the Black Spider. And of course, the hoard of powerful magic rumored to be hidden in the mines is a rich prize.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"367\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Character Level</span></span> <p>This part of the adventure is designed for characters of at least 4th level and assumes that each character has earned at least 2,700 XP. If the adventurers skipped too many of the optional investigations and encounters in part 3, they might not be 4th level, and many of the encounters in this section might be difficult for them.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"368\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Experience Point Awards</span></span> <p>In this part of the adventure, XP is awarded for overcoming monsters, as in parts 2 and 3. However, XP awards for monsters is not given in the encounter description. Instead, the amount of XP that a monster is worth is noted in us stat block. You calculate the award by totaling the value for each monster the characters overcome. Additional XP awards, and the reasons for them, are described in the text, under the \"Awarding Experience Points\" heading.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"369\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Wandering Monsters</span></span> <p>Monsters roam through all areas of the mine. Random encounters remind players that monsters aren't necessarily confined to specific areas, and that no part of the dungeon is safe. Encounters with wandering monsters are an effective way to keep the players and characters on their toes, alleviate player boredom, and tax party resources. However, having too many random encounters can become tedious, so use them sparingly.</p><p>If the characters spend a long time in a given area, you can check for wandering monsters by rolling a d20. On a roll of 17-20, an encounter takes place. Conversely, if the players seem restless, you can decide that an encounter occurs. Roll a d12 and consult the Wandering Monsters table to determine what the party meets.</p><table class=\"rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><caption>Wandering Monsters</caption><thead><tr><th data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Roll</th><th data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Result</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1-3</td><td>@Actor[S7suVGffLjLuj1a9]{Stirges} ([[/r 2d4]])</td></tr><tr><td>4-5</td><td>@Actor[98FaYs18rvxdZaLN]{Ghouls} ([[/r 1d4]])</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>@Actor[CuqpfWrKcbkMqUur]{Gricks} ([[/r 1d4]])</td></tr><tr><td>7-8</td><td>@Actor[RMgVVdcOBDTOuje3]{Bugbears} ([[/r 1d4]])</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>@Actor[Kh5lSv5HYhI1Wnr6]{Skeletons} ([[/r 1d6]])</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>@Actor[I8yy9SWJdocyivbL]{Zombies} ([[/r 1d6]])</td></tr><tr><td>11-12</td><td>@Actor[QsOYYPXmXUqrTw8n]{Ochre Jelly} (1)</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/LMoP/Wave Echo Cave.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Wave Echo Cave\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/LMoP/Wave Echo Cave.jpg\" />\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">Wave Echo Cave</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div></div><p></p><p></p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/LMoP/Wave Echo Cave (Player).jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Wave Echo Cave (Player)\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/LMoP/Wave Echo Cave (Player).jpg\" />\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">Wave Echo Cave (Player)</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div></div><p></p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"370\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">General Features</span></span> <p>The mine is cold, damp, and surprisingly drafty.

The rhythmic thunder of pounding waves echoes throughout the mine, loud enough to make the stone underfoot shiver. Waves come about two minutes apart, growing louder toward the northeast.</p><p>Wave Echo Cave is nowhere near the ocean, but a water-filled cavern deep in the mine is connected to an underground hot spring. That spring boils over continuously to produce a surge that slams into a narrow funnel, making a sound like breaking surf. Describe this sound to players on occasion.

In the western part of the cave, behind the column of rock, are three bedrolls and a heap of ordinary supplies-sacks of flour, bags of salt, casks of salted meat, lanterns, flasks of lamp oil, pickaxes, shovels, and other gear. Amid the supplies, you see the body of a dwarf miner, dead for at least a week.</p><p>The northeastern section of the cavern has collapsed, forming a ten-foot-wide, twenty-foot-deep pit. A sturdy hemp rope is tied off around a nearby stalagmite and dangles down the side of the pit, at the bottom of which is a rough-hewn tunnel heading northwest and east.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>This was the campsite of the Rockseekers. The dead dwarf is Tharden, Gundren's brother, who was killed by the Black Spider. Gundren's other brother, Nundro, was here as well and is currently the Black Spider's prisoner in area 20.</p><p>The dwarves' supplies are potentially useful, but not particularly valuable.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"380\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Open Pit</span></span> <p>Climbing up or down the wall of the pit without a rope requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.

The ceilings here are only six feet high, and several of the passages end in partially excavated rock faces.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>The dead-end passages are places where the miners gave up and decided to move on to other spots. Patiently lurking in one is an @Actor[QsOYYPXmXUqrTw8n]{ochre jelly}.

Old Entrance</span></span> <p>The tunnel that runs south was the original entrance to Wave Echo Cave, but it was buried by the destruction that wracked the mines centuries ago. A pitched battle was fought here when the orcs stormed the mines. The dead still lie where they fell.</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><p>Many tunnels intersect at this natural, thirty-foot-high cavern. The walls are carved with simple reliefs showing dwarf and gnome miners hard at work. Below them, nearly two dozen skeletons in rusted scraps of armor are scattered across the cavern floor. Some are dwarf skeletons, while others are orc remains. Half a dozen large brass lanterns stand in niches or on ledges around the cavern, but none are lit.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>Clinging to the ceiling like bats are ten @Actor[S7suVGffLjLuj1a9]{stirges}. The monsters find scant living prey in the mines, and they are ravenous. If the characters are looking down at the skeletons on the floor, the stirges are likely get the drop on them. Any character who isn't watching the ceiling is surprised unless his or her passive Wisdom (Perception) score is higher than the stirges' Dexterity (Stealth) check total (roll once for all of them).

The drow is still formulating a plan to get past the undead guardians in this area.</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><p>A blast furnace and a mechanical bellows powered by a waterwheel dominate this large chamber. The furnace is cold and dark, but heaps of coal are piled nearby, along with carts full of unrefined ore. The waterwheel sits in a ten-foot-wide channel cut into the floor of the room, but the channel is dry. Passages exit to the west, south, and east. The empty channel exits to the north and east.</p><p>More than a dozen withered corpses are scattered around the room. These slain dwarves and orcs are still wearing the remnants of their armor. Floating above them is a skull engulfed in green flame.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>Eight of the fallen dwarf warriors are @Actor[I8yy9SWJdocyivbL]{zombies}. They rise and pursue any living creatures that enter the room, but they do not pursue creatures outside this area for more than 1 round. In addition, a far more intelligent undead guards this area: a @Actor[iFr7pANlwI0cHoDc]{flameskull}. This creature was a servant of the human wizards allied with the Phandelver dwarves and gnomes, and it continues to act on ancient instructions to prevent intruders from passing through.</p><p>This impressive chamber was the heart of the Wave Echo Cave mining operation. Here, the dwarves melted down their ore to refine ingots of silver, gold, and platinum. The dry channel is where the dwarves diverted the stream from area 18 to power the waterwheel here. That in turn operated the bellows that fed the furnace.</p><p>The channel's bottom is 5 feet below floor level, and no ability check is required to scramble in or out. Characters in the channel can follow it out of this room to the north or to the east, though the ceiling is only 5 feet high after the channel exits this room.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"397\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">13.

Dozens of skeletons-many crushed under fallen debris-are scattered across the floor.</p><p>The cave is large enough that it contains two freestanding structures. Each of these stone buildings is proportioned for human use, as opposed to the dwarf-sized doorways and furnishings you've seen elsewhere in the mines. Both structures have battered and blackened masonry walls, their double doors cracked and scorched. The cavern is divided by an escarpment, into which a flight of stairs has been cut.</p><p>Passages lead out of this area to the north, south, and west.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>The damaged buildings are described in areas 14 and 15. Minerals in the ceiling are pretty, but they are neither magical nor valuable.</p><p>Any character proficient in Arcana can sense a subtle aura of magic in this cavern. (A @Item[5fui1RaHT1TYTAA7]{detect magic} spell reveals the same.) The aura becomes stronger as one approaches the northern building (area 15).</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"398\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">14.

Wrenching or smashing open the doors requires a successful DC 15 Strength check.</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><p>Dust, ash, walls blackened by fire, and heaps of debris beneath the sagging ceiling show that this room was damaged by a destructive blast. The furnishings-tables, chairs, bookshelves, beds-are charred or splintered, but otherwise well preserved. A scorched iron chest stands near the foot of one of the beds.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>This room contains the restless spirit of the last wizard to die here: @Actor[KD3moR3DfiImLJ4Y]{Mormesk the wraith}. He is not immediately visible but rises up out of the floor when a living creature enters the room.</p><p>Mormesk was a powerful mage until he met his end in the spell battle at the climax of the orc attack. Centuries of anger have poisoned his soul, transforming him into a hate-filled apparition.</p><p>Mormesk leads the undead that haunt Wave Echo Cave. The wraith spends his time here because the treasure he had amassed in life is in the scorched chest (see the \"Treasure\" section). No longer corporeal, he cannot touch or possess the wealth he enjoyed in life.</p><p>This building served as a guesthouse for visiting wizards working in the Forge of Spells (area 15), most of whom were humans from nearby cities. The furnishings are all human proportioned.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"399\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Roleplaying Mormesk</span></span> <p>Mormesk speaks in grave whispers. When the wraith first rises up from the floor, it says, \"Your presence is offensive to me, your life forfeit. My treasures are mine alone, not yours to plunder!\" If the characters make no attempt to reason with the wraith, it attacks.</p><p>If the characters try to reason with the wraith, it listens to what they have to say, provided they have not harmed it in any way or seized any of its property. The wraith is irrevocably evil, so the only way the characters can stay its spectral hand is to offer it something a former wizard would consider valuable in exchange for their lives. Mormesk values magic items (particularly scrolls), spellbooks, and arcane knowledge. Whatever the gift, a character must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince the wraith of its value.</p><p>Regardless of what the characters offer it, the wraith won't relinquish the wooden pipe in the scorched chest. It will, however, part with the coins and gems if the characters agree to kill the spectator in the Forge of Spells. (The wraith doesn't explain what a spectator is. It merely points toward area 15.) Once it receives its gift, the wraith allows characters to peruse its books and keep the secret map in one of them (see the \"Treasure\" section).</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"400\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Treasure</span></span> <p>The scorched chest is unlocked and contains 1,100 cp, 160 sp, 50 ep, three diamonds (100 gp each), and a wooden pipe adorned with platinum filigree (150 gp).</p><p>A handful of magically preserved tomes remain on the shelves. Most are just histories, but one has a map sewn into its cover. The map's presence can be discerned with a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The map shows the location of a dungeon of your own creation. When the characters finish their explorations here, this old map can lead them to their next adventure.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"401\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">15. Forge of Spells</span></span> <p>Here is where the wizards allied with the dwarves and gnomes of the Phandelver's Pact channeled the magic of these caverns to enchant dwarven arms and gnome gadgets. The northernmost door is scorched and cracked, its iron hinges partially melted; forcing it open requires a successful DC 15 Strength check. The western double doors are just as damaged but stand slightly ajar.</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><p>This large workshop was badly damaged by the ancient spell battle that laid waste to the mine. Worktables taking up two corners of the room are scorched, and the plaster has been burned off the masonry walls. In the middle of the room, a stone pedestal holds a small brazier in which an eerie green flame dances and crackles. The brazier and its pedestal appear to have been untouched by the forces that destroyed this area.</p><p>Behind the brazier of green flame floats a spherical creature measuring roughly four feet in diameter. Four eyestalks protrude from its central mass, two on each side. In the center of the body is a large eye that stares at you. \"Hello,\" says a thick, burbling voice inside your head.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>The monster that guards this room is a @Actor[MuhshygOoNn75fpf]{spectator}. One of the human wizards who worked in the Forge of Spells summoned the creature to guard the magic items created and stored here. When the mine was sacked, the orcs disturbed the delicate magic in the area, unhinging the spectator's grip on reality. It has become deranged and believes that the mine is still in use, ignoring all evidence to the contrary.</p><p>The wraith (area 14) wants to drive off or kill the spectator, but so far, the creature has easily handled the assaults of Mormesk's zombies and ghouls while seeing nothing strange about undead roaming the mine. If the party attempts to remove anything from this area, the spectator attacks. If the spectator is blinded somehow, it disappears back to its home plane, convinced that it can no longer perform the task for which it was summoned.</p><p>With a successful DC 15 Charisma (Deception) check, a character can trick the spectator into thinking one or more party members are wizards or miners who work for the owners of Wave Echo Cave, sent to terminate the spectator's employment. If the deception succeeds, the spectator believes it is released from its obligations, and it disappears and returns to its home plane.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"402\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Brazier of Green Flame</span></span> <p>A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check identifies the brazier as the source of the magic that suffuses the surrounding caverns. This magic has waned over the years, to the extent that it can no longer be harnessed to permanently enchant magic items. However, any nonmagical weapon or armor bathed in the green flame for at least 1 minute becomes a @Item[qTvPujiJelpVvvV2]{+1 weapon} or @Item[ySDqGEvjR4GUsych]{+1 armor}, respectively, for 1d12 hours.

The rhythmic booming heard throughout the mines is louder here. At regular intervals, a fresh surge of water funnels into this chamber and slams against the wall just below the ledge. The echo suggests that this cave might be one arm of a much larger cavern to the northeast.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>The ledge that hugs the south wall is 15 feet above water level. However, when water surges into the cave every 2 minutes, it raises the water level by 10 feet.

It might have been a streambed, though no water flows here now.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>The dwarves diverted the stream into the channel leading to area 12 to drive the waterwheel in the smelter. Then the earthquakes that rocked Wave Echo Cave during the final spell battle of the orc invasion collapsed the floor in area 18, diverting the stream once again. The old streambed remains as a usable passage that circumvents the undead in area 12, although Nezznar has not yet discovered this.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"407\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">18.

For the adventurers' service to their family, they gladly award the party a 10 percent share of the mine's profits. If the characters want to remain in Phandalin and perhaps restore Tresendar Manor or establish homes of their own, the people of the area are glad to have them stay. Even if they choose to move on in search of new adventures, they'll always have a warm welcome in Phandalin.</p><p>By the end of the adventure, the characters should be 5th level. If your players wish to continue playing their characters, you can use the contents of this set to create your own adventures; the mysterious map found in area 14 of Wave Echo Cave provides one possible adventure hook, but feel free to explore other ideas using the monsters, magic items, and locations in this adventure. If you want to create adventures for characters higher than 5th level, you'll need the basic rules online or the advanced rulebooks: the <i>Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide</i> and <i>Monster Manual</i>.</p></div></div></div>","folder":"eLftZ2PrXJG6TlKO","sort":400000,"permission":{"default":0,"h9Ix1v77jOO90FDx":3},"flags":{"srd5e":{"source":"LMoP"}},"_id":"J7eytMdrbKc5gfcd"}

The journey takes them south along the High Road to the Triboar Trail, which heads east (as shown on the overland map). When they're a half-day's march from Phandalin, they run into trouble with goblin raiders from the Cragmaw tribe.</p><p>Read the boxed text when you're ready to start. If you create a different adventure hook, skip to the second paragraph and adjust the details as necessary, ignoring the information about driving the wagon.</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><p>In the city of Neverwinter, a dwarf named Gundren Rockseeker asked you to bring a wagonload of provisions to the rough-and-tumble settlement of Phandalin, a couple of days' travel southeast of the city. Gundren was clearly excited and more than a little secretive about his reasons for the trip, saying only that he and his brothers had found \"something big,\" and that he'd pay you ten gold pieces each for escorting his supplies safely to Barthen's Provisions, a trading post in Phandalin. He then set out ahead of you on horse, along with a warrior escort named Sildar Hallwinter, claiming he needed to arrive early to \"take care of business.\"</p><p>You've spent the last few days following the High Road south from Neverwinter, and you've just recently veered east along the Triboar Trail.</p><p>You've encountered no trouble so far, but this territory can be dangerous. Bandits and outlaws have been known to lurk along the trail.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>Before continuing with the adventure, take a few minutes to do the following:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">Encourage the players to introduce their characters to each other if they haven't done so already.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Ask the players to think about how their characters came to know their dwarf patron, Gundren Rockseeker. Let the players concoct their own stories. If a player is hard-pressed to think of anything, suggest something simple. For example, Gundren could be a childhood friend or someone who helped the player's character get out of a tough scrape. This exercise is a great opportunity for the players to contribute to the adventure's backstory.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Ask the players to give you the party's marching order and how their characters are traveling. Who's in front, and who's bringing up the rear? If the characters are escorting Gundren's wagonload of supplies, then one or two characters need to be driving the wagon. The rest of the characters can be riding on the wagon, walking alongside, or scouting ahead, as they like.</li></ul><p><b>Driving the Wagon</b></p><p>Any character can drive a wagon, and no particular skill is necessary. Two oxen pull the wagon. If no one is holding the reins, the oxen stop where they are.</p><p>The wagon is packed full of an assortment of mining supplies and food. This includes a dozen sacks of flour, several casks of salted pork, two kegs of strong ale, shovels, picks, and crowbars (about a dozen each), and five lanterns with a small barrel of oil (about fifty flasks in volume). The total value of the cargo is 100 gp.</p><p>When you're ready, continue with the \"Goblin Ambush\" section.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"115\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Goblin Ambush</span></span> <p>Read the following boxed text to start the encounter:</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><p>You've been on the Triboar Trail for about half a day. As you come around a bend, you spot two dead horses sprawled about fifty feet ahead of you, blocking the path. Each has several black-feathered arrows sticking out of it. The woods press close to the trail here, with a steep embankment and dense thickets on either side.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>If you are using the \"Meet Me in Phandalin\" adventure hook, then any character who approaches to make a closer investigation can identify the horses as belonging to Gundren Rockseeker and Sildar Hallwinter. They've been dead about a day, and it's clear that arrows killed the horses. When the characters inspect the scene closer, read the following:</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><p>The saddlebags have been looted. Nearby lies an empty leather map case.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>Four @Actor[Ff1ALgTHwip0EOzr]{goblins} are hiding in the woods, two on each side of the road. They wait until someone approaches the bodies and then attack.</p><p>This will likely be the first of many combat encounters in the adventure. Here are the steps you should follow to run it effectively:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">Review the goblin stat block in appendix B. Since the goblins are hiding, you'll need to know their Stealth skill modifier: +6.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Check to see who, if anyone, is surprised. The party cannot surprise the goblins, but the goblins might surprise some or all the characters. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check for the goblins, rolling once for all of them. Roll a d20, add the goblins' Stealth skill modifier (+6) to the roll, and compare the result to the characters' passive Wisdom (Perception) scores. Any character whose score is lower than the goblins' check result is surprised and loses his or her turn during the first round of combat (see \"Surprise\" in the rulebook).</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Use the initiative rules in the rulebook to determine who acts first, second, third, and so on. Keep track of everyone's initiative count in the margins of this book or on a separate piece of paper.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">When the time comes for the goblins to act, two of them rush forward and make melee attacks while two goblins stand 30 feet away from the party and make ranged attacks. The goblins' stat block contains the information you need to resolve these attacks. For more information on what the goblins can do on their turn, see chapter 2, \"Combat,\" in the rulebook.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">When three goblins are defeated, the last goblin attempts to flee, heading for the goblin trail.</li></ul><p><b>Developments</b></p><p>In the unlikely event that the goblins defeat the adventurers, they leave them unconscious, loot them and the wagon, then head back to the Cragmaw hideout. The characters can continue on to Phandalin, buy new gear at Barthen's Provisions, return to the ambush site, and find the goblins' trail.</p><p>The characters might capture one or more goblins by knocking them unconscious instead of killing them. A character can use any melee weapon to knock a goblin unconscious, succeeding if the attack deals enough damage to drop the goblin to 0 hit points. Once it regains consciousness after a few minutes, a captured goblin can be convinced to share what it knows (see the \"What the Goblins Know\" sidebar on page 8). A goblin can also be persuaded to lead the party to the Cragmaw hideout while avoiding traps along the way (see the \"Goblin Trail\" section).</p><p>The characters might not find the goblin trail, or they could decide to continue to Phandalin. In that case, skip ahead to part 2, \"Phandalin.\" Elmar Barthen (the owner of Barthen's Provisions) seeks out the characters and informs them that Gundren Rockseeker never arrived. He recounts the goblin troubles and suggests that the characters return to the ambush site to investigate further (after they rest). Barthen also tells the party that Linene Graywind of the Lionshield Coster (see page 16) can provide more information on the goblin attacks.</p><p><b>Rests</b></p><p>The party might need to rest after the goblin ambush, depending on how the battle plays out. See the rulebook for more information on short rests and long rests.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"116\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Goblin Trail</span></span> <p>After the characters defeat the goblins, any inspection of the area reveals that the creatures have been using this place to stage ambushes for some time. A trail hidden behind thickets on the north side of the road leads northwest. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check recognizes that about a dozen goblins have come and gone along the trail, as well as signs of two human-sized bodies being hauled away from the ambush site.</p><p>The party can easily steer the wagon away from the road and tie off the oxen while the group pursues the goblins.</p><p>The trail leads five miles northwest and ends at the Cragmaw hideout (see that section). Ask the players to determine the party's marching order as the characters move down the trail. The order is important, because the goblins have set two traps to thwart pursuers.</p><p><b>Snare.</b> About 10 minutes after heading down the trail, a party on the path encounters a hidden snare. If the characters are searching for traps, the character in the lead spots the trap automatically if his or her passive Wisdom (Perception) score is 12 or higher. Otherwise, the character must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the trap. If the character fails to notice the trap, he or she triggers the snare and must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the character is suspended upside down 10 feet above the ground. The character is restrained until 1 or more slashing damage is dealt to the snare's cord. (See the appendix in the rulebook for the effect of being restrained.) A character who isn't carefully lowered down takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage from the fall.</p><p><b>Pit.</b> Another 10 minutes down the trail is a pit the goblins have camouflaged. The pit is 6 feet wide, 10 feet deep, and it triggers when a creature moves across it. The character in the lead spots the hidden pit automatically if his or her passive Wisdom (Perception) score is 15 or higher. Otherwise, the character must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot the hidden pit. If the trap isn't detected, the lead character must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall in, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage. The pit's walls are not steep, so no ability check is required to scramble out.</p><p><b>Awarding Experience Points</b></p><p>Defeating the goblin ambushers and finding the Cragmaw hideout completes a story milestone. When the party arrives at the hideout, award each character 75 XP. Make sure the players record this gain on their character sheets.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"117\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Cragmaw Hideout</span></span> <p>The Cragmaw tribe of goblins has established a hideout from which it can easily harass and plunder traffic moving along the Triboar Trail or the path to Phandalin. The Cragmaw tribe is so named because each member of the tribe sharpens its teeth so they appear fierce and jagged.</p><p>The leader of the Cragmaw bandits lairing here is a bugbear named Klarg, who has orders from the chief of the Cragmaws to plunder any poorly defended caravans or travelers that come this way. A few days ago, a messenger from Cragmaw Castle brought new instructions: Waylay the dwarf Gundren Rockseeker and anyone traveling with him.</p><p></p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/LMoP/Cragmaw Hideout.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Cragmaw Hideout\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/LMoP/Cragmaw Hideout.jpg\" />\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">Cragmaw Hideout</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div></div><p></p><p></p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/LMoP/Cragmaw Hideout (Player).jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Cragmaw Hideout (Player)\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/LMoP/Cragmaw Hideout (Player).jpg\" />\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">Cragmaw Hideout (Player)</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div></div><p></p><p><b>Adventure Maps</b></p><p>Maps that appear in this adventure are for the DM's eyes only.</p><p>A map not only shows an adventure location in its entirety but also shows secret doors, hidden traps, and other elements the players aren't meant to see-hence the need for secrecy.</p><p>Maps are best used to show multiroom lairs and other locations that have many places to explore. Therefore, not every location needs a map.</p><p>When the players arrive at a location marked on a map, you can either rely on a verbal description to give them a clear mental picture of the location, or you can draw what they see on a separate piece of graph paper, copying what's on your map while omitting details as appropriate.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"118\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Scale and Grid</span></span> <p>A scale allows you to measure distances and dimensions accurately, which is important for combat encounters, magical effects, and light sources, among other things.

He answers to King Grol, chief of the Cragmaw tribe, who dwells in Cragmaw Castle. (The goblins can provide basic directions to Cragmaw Castle. It's about twenty miles northeast of the Cragmaw hideout, in Neverwinter Wood.)</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Klarg received a messenger goblin from King Grol a few days ago. The messenger told him that someone named the Black Spider was paying the Cragmaws to watch out for the dwarf Gundren Rockseeker, capture him, and send him and anything he was carrying back to King Grol. Klarg followed his orders. Gundren was ambushed and taken along with his personal effects, including a map.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">The dwarf and his map were delivered to King Grol, as instructed. The dwarf's human companion is being held in the \"eating cave\" (area 6).</li></ul></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"126\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">1. Cave Mouth</span></span> <p>The trail from the goblin ambush site leads to the entrance of the Cragmaw hideout.</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><p>Following the goblins' trail, you come across a large cave in a hillside five miles from the scene of the ambush. A shallow stream flows out of the cave mouth, which is screened by dense briar thickets. A narrow dry path leads into the cave on the right-hand side of the stream.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>The thicket in area 2 is impenetrable from the west side of the stream.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"127\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Developments</span></span> <p>The goblins in area 2 are supposed to be keeping watch on this area, but they are not paying attention. (Goblins can be lazy that way.) However, if the characters make a lot of noise here-for example, loudly arguing about what to do next, setting up a camp, cutting down brush, and so on-the goblins in area 2 notice and attack them through the thicket, which provides the goblins with three-quarters cover (see the rulebook for rules on cover).</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"128\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">2.

If the goblins notice intruders in area 1, they open fire with their bows, shooting through the thickets and probably catching the characters by surprise. If the goblins don't notice the adventurers in area 1, they spot them when they splash across the stream, and neither side is surprised.</p><p>Characters moving carefully or scouting ahead might be able to surprise the goblin lookouts.

The cave narrows to a steep fissure at the far end, and is filled with the stench of animals. Savage snarls and the sounds of rattling chains greet your ears where three wolves are chained up just inside the opening. Each wolf's chain leads to an iron rod driven into the base of a stalagmite.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>Three @Actor[BF1bWCp395fXJbxD]{wolves} are confined here. They can't reach targets standing on the steps, but all three attack any creature except a goblin that moves into the room (see the \"Developments\" section). Goblins in nearby caves ignore the sounds of fighting wolves, since they constantly snap and snarl at each other.</p><p>A character who tries to calm the animals can attempt a DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check.

At the base of the fissure is rubbish that's been discarded through the opening above. A character attempting to ascend or descend the chimney shaft must make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. If the check succeeds, the character moves at half speed up or down the shaft, as desired. On a check result of 6-9, the character neither gains nor loses ground; on a result of 5 or less, the character falls and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen, landing prone at the base of the shaft.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"132\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Developments</span></span> <p>If the wolves are goaded by enemies beyond their reach, they are driven into a frenzy that allows them to yank the iron rod securing their chains out of the floor.

Doing so requires a Wisdom (Perception) check contested by the goblin's Dexterity (Stealth) check result.</p><p>The goblin notices the characters if they carry any light or don't use stealth as they approach the bridge. The goblin does not attack. Instead, it attempts to sneak away to the east to inform its companions in area 7 to release a flood (see the \"Flood!\" section of area 5). The goblin moves undetected if its Dexterity (Stealth) check exceeds the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of any character who might notice its movements.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"134\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Western Passage</span></span> <p>This passage is choked with rubble and has steep escarpments.

Any creature on the ledge when it falls must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success.

A waterfall sounds out from a larger cavern somewhere ahead of you.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>If the characters didn't spot the bridge while navigating area 4, they spot it now. Add:</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><p>A rickety bridge spans the passage, connecting two tunnels that are 20 feet above the stream.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>One @Actor[Ff1ALgTHwip0EOzr]{goblin} stands watch on the bridge. It is hiding, and characters can spot it by succeeding on a Wisdom (Perception) check contested by the goblin's Dexterity (Stealth) check. This guard is lazy and inattentive. If no characters are using light sources, each character can attempt a Dexterity (Stealth) check against the goblin's passive Wisdom (Perception) score to creep by without being noticed.</p><p>If the goblin spots the adventurers, it signals the goblins in area 7 to release a flood (see the \"Flood!\" section), then throws javelins down at the characters.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"136\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Bridge</span></span> <p>This bridge spans the passage 20 feet above the stream. It's possible to climb up the cavern wails from the lower passage to the bridge. The 20-foot-high walls are rough but slick with spray, requiring a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to climb.</p></div><p>The bridge has an Armor Class (AC) of 5 and 10 hit points. If the bridge is reduced to 0 hit points, it collapses. Creatures on the collapsing bridge must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage and landing prone (see \"Being Prone\" in the rulebook). Those who succeed hold onto the bridge and must climb it to safety.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"137\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Flood!</span></span> <p>The large pools in area 7 have collapsible walls that can be yanked out of place to release a surge of water down the main passage of the lair. In the round after the goblins in area 7 are signaled by the lookout in area 5, they start knocking away the supports. In the following round on the goblins' initiative count, a water surge pours from area 7 down to area 1.</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><p>The passage is suddenly filled with a mighty roar, as a huge surge of rushing water pours down from above!</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>The flood threatens all creatures in the tunnel. (Creatures on the bridge at area 5 are out of danger, as are any characters successfully climbing the cavern walls.) Any creature within 10 feet of the disused passage at area 4 or the steps leading up to area 3 can attempt a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being swept away. A creature that fails to get out of the way can attempt a DC 15 Strength saving throw to hold on. On a failed save, the character is knocked prone and washed down to area 1, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage along the way.</p><p>The goblins in area 7 can release a second flood by opening the second pool, but they don't do this unless the goblin on the bridge tells them to. The goblin on the bridge waits to see if the first flood got rid of all the intruders before calling for the second to be released.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"138\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">6.

If he sees that the characters are getting the upper hand, he grabs Sildar and drags him over to the edge of the upper level. \"Truce, or this human dies!\" he shouts.</p><p>Yeemik wants to oust Klarg and become the new boss. If the adventurers agree to parley, Yeemik tries to convince them to kill Klarg in area 8, promising to release Sildar when they bring back the bugbear's head. Sildar groggily warns the characters that they shouldn't trust the goblin, and he's right. If the characters take the deal, Yeemik tries to force them to pay a rich ransom for Sildar even after they complete their part of the bargain.</p><p>If the characters refuse to parley, Yeemik shoves Sildar over the edge and continues with the fight. Sildar takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage from the fall, which is enough to drop him to 0 hit points.

He is an agent of the Lords' Alliance, a group of allied political powers concerned with mutual security and prosperity. Members of the order ensure the safety of cities and other settlements by proactively eliminating threats by any means, while bringing honor and glory to their leaders and homelands.</p><p>Sildar met Gundren Rockseeker in Neverwinter and agreed to accompany him back to Phandalin. Sildar wants to investigate the fate of Iarno Albrek, a human wizard and fellow member of the Lords' Alliance who disappeared shortly after arriving in Phandalin. Sildar hopes to learn what happened to Iarno, assist Gundren in reopening the old mine, and help restore Phandalin to a civilized center of wealth and prosperity.</p><p>Sildar provides the characters with four pieces of useful information:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">The three Rockseeker brothers (@Actor[HB5KY2Cp65joQY1c]{Gundren}, Tharden, and @Actor[EFOFElsomrFQMpKV]{Nundro}) recently located an entrance to the long-lost Wave Echo Cave, site of the mines of the Phandelver's Pact. (Share the information in the first two paragraphs of the \"Background\" section to the players at this time.)</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Klarg, the bugbear who leads this goblin band, had orders to waylay Gundren. Sildar heard from the goblins that the Black Spider sent word that the dwarf was to be brought to him. Sildar doesn't know who or what the Black Spider is.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Gundren had a map showing the secret location of Wave Echo Cave, but the goblins took it when they captured him. Sildar believes that Klarg sent the map and the dwarf to the chief of the Cragmaws at a place called Cragmaw Castle. Sildar doesn't know where that might be, but he suggests someone in Phandalin might know. (It doesn't occur to Sildar immediately, but a captured goblin might also be persuaded to divulge the castle's location. See the \"What the Goblins Know\" sidebar on page 8.)</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Sildar's contact in Phandalin is a human wizard named Iarno Albrek. The wizard traveled to the town two months ago to establish order there. After the Lords' Alliance received no word from Iarno, Sildar decided to investigate.</li></ul><p>Sildar tells the characters that he intends to continue on to Phandalin, since it's the nearest settlement. He offers to pay the party 50 gp to provide escort. Although he has no money on him, Sildar can secure a loan to pay the characters within a day after arriving in Phandalin. First, he hopes they'll put a stop to the goblin raids by clearing out the caves.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"140\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Developments</span></span> <p>If he is rescued and healed, Sildar Hallwinter remains with the party but is anxious to reach Phandalin as quickly as possible. He doesn't have any weapons or armor, but he can take a shortsword from a defeated goblin or use a weapon loaned to him by a character.</p><p>If Sildar joins the party, see the \"NPC Party Members\" sidebar for tips on how to run him.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"141\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Treasure</span></span> <p>Yeemik carries a pouch containing three gold teeth (1 gp each) and 15 sp.

Here are some tips to help you run an NPC party member:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">Let the characters make the important decisions. They are the protagonists of the adventure. If the characters ask an NPC party member for advice or direction, remember that NPCs make mistakes too.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">An NPC won't deliberately put himself or herself in harm's way unless there's a good reason to do so.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">An NPC won't treat all party members the same way, which can create some fun friction. As an NPC gets to know the characters, think about which characters the NPC likes most and which characters the NPC likes least, and let those likes and dislikes affect how the NPC interacts with the various party members.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">In a combat encounter, keep the NPC's actions simple and straightforward. Also, look for things that the NPC can do besides fighting. For example, an NPC might stabilize a dying character, guard a prisoner, or help barricade a door.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">If an NPC contributes greatly to the party's success in a battle, the NPC should receive an equal share of the XP earned for the encounter. (The characters receive less XP as a consequence.)</li><li class=\"rd__li \">NPCs have their own lives and goals. Consequently, an NPC should remain with the party only as long as makes sense for those goals.</li></ul></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"142\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">7.

During the course of the adventure, the characters will advance to 5th level. The adventure is set a short distance from the city of Neverwinter in the Sword Coast region of the Forgotten Realms setting. The Sword Coast is part of the North—a vast realm of free settlements surrounded by wilderness and adventure. You don't need to be a Forgotten Realms expert to run the adventure; everything you need to know about the setting is contained in this book.</p><p>If this is your first time running a D&amp;D adventure, read \"The Dungeon Master\" section; it will help you better understand your role and responsibilities.</p><p>The \"Background\" section tells you everything you need to know to set up the adventure. The \"Overview\" section describes how the adventure is expected to run and gives you a broad sense of what the player characters should be doing at any given time.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"104\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Dungeon Master</span></span> <p>The Dungeon Master (DM) has a special role in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game.</p><p>The DM is a <b>referee</b>. When it's not clear what ought to happen next, the DM decides how to apply the rules and keep the story going.</p><p>The DM is a <b>narrator</b>. The DM sets the pace of the story and presents the various challenges and encounters the players must overcome. The DM is the players' interface to the D&amp;D world, as well as the one who reads (and sometimes also writes) the adventure and describes what happens in response to the characters' actions.</p><p>The DM <b>plays monsters</b>. The DM plays the monsters and villains the adventurers battle against, choosing their actions and rolling dice for their attacks. The DM also plays the part of all the other characters the players meet in the course of their adventures, like the prisoner in the goblin lair or the innkeeper in town.</p><p>Who should be the DM for your gaming group? Whoever wants to be! The person who has the most drive to pull a group together and start up a game often ends up being the DM by default, but that doesn't have to be the case.</p><p>Although the DM controls the monsters and villains in the adventure, the relationship between the players and the DM isn't adversarial. The DM's job is to challenge the characters with interesting encounters and tests, keep the game moving, and apply the rules fairly.</p><p>The most important thing to remember about being a good DM is that the rules are a tool to help you have a good time. The rules aren't in charge. You're the DM-you're in charge of the game. Guide the play experience and the use of the rules so that everybody has fun.</p><p>Many players of Dungeons &amp; Dragons find that being the DM is the best part of the game. With the information in this adventure, you'll be prepared to take on that role for your group.</p><p><b>Rules to Game By</b></p><p>As the Dungeon Master, you are the final authority when it comes to rules questions or disputes. Here are some guidelines to help you arbitrate issues as they come up.</p><p><b>When in doubt, make it up!</b> It's better to keep the game moving than to get bogged down in the rules.</p><p><b>It's not a competition.</b> The DM isn't competing against the player characters. You're there to run the monsters, referee the</p><p>rules, and keep the story moving.</p><p><b>It's a shared story.</b> It's the group's story, so let the players contribute to the outcome through the actions of their</p><p>characters. Dungeons &amp; Dragons is about imagination and coming together to tell a story as a group. Let the players participate in the storytelling.</p><p><b>Be consistent.</b> If you decide that a rule works a certain way in one session, make sure it works that way the next time it comes into play.</p><p><b>Make sure everyone is involved.</b> Ensure every character has a chance to shine. If some players are reluctant to speak up, remember to ask them what their characters are doing.</p><p><b>Be fair.</b> Use your powers as Dungeon Master only for good. Treat the rules and the players in a fair and impartial manner.</p><p><b>Pay attention.</b> Make sure you look around the table occasionally to see if the game is going well. If everyone seems to be having fun, relax and keep going. If the fun is waning, it might be time for a break, or you can try to liven things up.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"105\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Improvising Ability Checks</span></span> <p>The adventure often tells you what ability checks characters might try in a certain situation and the Difficulty Class (DC) of those checks. Sometimes adventurers try things that the adventure can't possibly anticipate. It's up to you to decide whether their attempts are successful. If it seems like anyone should have an easy time doing it, don't ask for an ability check; just tell the player what happens. Likewise, if there's no way anyone could accomplish the task, just tell the player it doesn't work.</p><p>Otherwise, answer these three simple questions:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">What kind of ability check?</li><li class=\"rd__li \">How hard is it?</li><li class=\"rd__li \">What's the result?</li></ul><p>Use the descriptions of the ability scores and their associated skills in the rulebook to help you decide what kind of ability check to use. Then determine how hard the task is so that you can set the DC for the check. The higher the DC, the more difficult the task. The easiest way to set a DC is to decide whether the task's difficulty is easy, moderate, or hard, and use these three DCs:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \"><b>Easy (DC 10)</b>. An easy task requires a minimal level of competence or a modicum of luck to accomplish.</li><li class=\"rd__li \"><b>Moderate (DC 15)</b>. A moderate task requires a slightly higher level of competence to accomplish. A character with a combination of natural aptitude and specialized training can accomplish a moderate task more often than not.</li><li class=\"rd__li \"><b>Hard (DC 20)</b>. Hard tasks include any effort that is beyond the capabilities of most people without aid or exceptional ability.</li></ul><p>Even with aptitude and training, a character needs some amount of luck-or a lot of specialized training-to pull off a hard task.</p><p>The outcome of a successful check is usually easy to determine: the character succeeds at whatever he or she set out to accomplish, within reason. It's usually equally easy to figure out what happens when a character fails a check: the character simply doesn't succeed.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"106\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Glossary</span></span> <p>The adventure uses terms that might be unfamiliar to you. A few of these terms are described here. For descriptions of rules-specific terms, see the rulebook.</p><p><b>Characters.</b> This term refers to the adventurers run by the players. They are the protagonists in any D&amp;D adventure. A group of characters or adventurers is called a party.</p><p><b>Nonplayer Characters (NPCs).</b> This term refers to characters run by the DM. How an NPC behaves is dictated by the adventure and by the DM.</p><p><b>Boxed Text.</b> At various places, the adventure presents descriptive text that's meant to be read or paraphrased aloud to players. This read-aloud text is offset in boxes. Boxed text is most commonly used to describe rooms or present bits of scripted dialogue.</p><p><b>Stat Block.</b> Any monster or NPC that is likely to be involved in combat requires game statistics so that the DM can run it effectively. These statistics are presented in a format called a statistics block, or stat block. You'll find the stat blocks needed for this adventure in appendix B.</p><p><b>Tenday.</b> In the Forgotten Realms, a week is ten days long and called a tenday. Each month consists of three tendays—thirty days total.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"107\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Magic Items and Monsters</span></span> <p>Whenever the text refers to a magic item, its name is presented in italic type.

In addition to its mineral wealth, the mine contained great magical power. Human spellcasters allied themselves with the dwarves and gnomes to channel and bind that energy into a great forge (called the Forge of Spells), where magic items could be crafted. Times were good, and the nearby human town of Phandalin (pronounced fan-duh-lin) prospered as well. But then disaster struck when orcs swept through the North and laid waste to all in their path.</p><p>A powerful force of orcs reinforced by evil mercenary wizards attacked Wave Echo Cave to seize its riches and magic treasures. Human wizards fought alongside their dwarf and gnome allies to defend the Forge of Spells, and the ensuing spell battle destroyed much of the cavern. Few survived the cave-ins and tremors, and the location of Wave Echo Cave was lost.</p><p>For centuries, rumors of buried riches have attracted treasure seekers and opportunists to the area around Phandalin, but no one has ever succeeded in locating the lost mine. In recent years, people have resettled the area. Phandalin is now a rough-and-tumble frontier town. More important, the Rockseeker brothers—a trio of dwarves-have discovered the entrance to Wave Echo Cave, and they intend to reopen the mines.</p><p>Unfortunately for the Rockseekers, they are not the only ones interested in Wave Echo Cave. A mysterious villain known as the Black Spider controls a network of bandit gangs and goblin tribes in the area, and his agents have followed the Rockseekers to their prize. Now the Black Spider wants Wave Echo Cave for himself, and he is taking steps to make sure no one else knows where it is.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"110\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Overview</span></span> <p>Lost Mine of Phandelver is divided into four parts. In part 1, \"Goblin Arrows,\" the adventurers are on the road to the town of Phandalin when they stumble into a goblin ambush. They discover that the goblins (who belong to the Cragmaw tribe) have captured their dwarf friend @Actor[HB5KY2Cp65joQY1c]{Gundren Rockseeker} and his escort, a human warrior named Sildar Hallwinter. The characters must deal with the ambushers and then follow their trail back to the goblins' hideout. They rescue Sildar and learn from him that Gundren and his brothers discovered a famous lost mine. Sildar knows only that Gundren and his map have been taken to somewhere called \"Cragmaw Castle.\"</p><p>In part 2, \"Phandalin,\" the characters arrive in Phandalin to find it terrorized by the Redbrands, a gang of miscreants led by a mysterious figure called Glasstaff. A number of interesting NPCs can also be found in Phandalin, laying the hooks for short adventures in part 3. The Redbrands try to run the characters out of town, so the characters return the favor and storm the Redbrand lair. In a hidden stronghold beneath an old manor, they find that Iarno \"Glasstaff\" Albrek, the leader of the Redbrands, is taking his orders from someone called the Black Spider-and that the Black Spider wants the adventurers out of the picture.</p><p>Part 3, \"The Spider's Web,\" provides the characters with several short adventures in the region around Phandalin as they search for more information about the Black Spider and the dwarves' lost mine. The clues the characters picked up in Phandalin can lead them to spy on a mysterious wizard at the ruins of Old Owl Well, seek the advice of a dangerous banshee, oust a band of orcs lurking at Wyvern Tor, and investigate the ruins of the town of Thundertree.</p><p>Several of these leads point to Cragmaw Castle, which is the stronghold of King Grol, leader of the Cragmaw goblins. Here the characters discover that the Black Spider is a drow adventurer named Nezznar, and that the Cragmaw goblins work for him (drow are elves who hail from a realm deep underground). More importantly, they recover Gundren Rockseeker's map to the lost mine, or learn the mine's location from one of the other leads they unearth during part 3.</p><p>Following the map or the directions to the lost mine brings the characters to part 4, \"Wave Echo Cave.\" That lost underground complex is now overrun by undead and strange monsters. Nezznar the Black Spider is there with his loyal followers, exploring the mines and searching for the legendary Forge of Spells. The adventurers have the opportunity to avenge Gundren Rockseeker, to ensure the prosperity and security of Phandalin by clearing the rich mine of its monsters, and to put an end to the troublemaking of the Black Spider-if they can survive the dangers of the Lost Mine of Phandelver.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"111\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Adventure Hook</span></span> <p>You can let players invent their own reasons for visiting Phandalin, or you can use the following adventure hook. The backgrounds and secondary goals on the character sheets also provide characters with motivations for visiting Phandalin.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"112\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Meet Me in Phandalin</span></span> <p>The characters are in the city of Neverwinter when their dwarf patron and friend, Gundren Rockseeker, hires them to escort a wagon to Phandalin. Gundren has gone ahead with a warrior, Sildar Hallwinter, to attend to business in the town while the characters follow with the supplies. The characters will be paid 10 gp each by the owner of Barthen's Provisions in Phandalin when they deliver the wagon safely to that trading post.</p></div><p><b>Roleplaying and Inspiration</b></p><p>One of the things that you can do as the DM is reward players for roleplaying their characters well.</p><p>Each of the characters included in this set has two personality traits (one positive and one negative), an ideal, a bond, and a flaw. These elements can make the character easier and more fun to roleplay. Personality traits provide a glimpse into the character's likes, dislikes, accomplishments, fears, attitude, or mannerisms. An ideal is something that the character believes in or strives for above all else. A character's bond represents a connection to a person, place, or event in the world-someone the character cares about, a place the holds a special connection, or a treasured possession. A flaw is a characteristic that someone else can exploit to bring the character to ruin or cause the character to act against his or her best interests.</p><p>When a player roleplays a negative personality trait or gives in to the drawbacks presented by a bond or flaw, you can give that player one inspiration as a reward. A player with inspiration can use it in a situation where his or her character's personality traits, ideal, or bond relate to what's happening. Spending inspiration gives the character advantage on one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. A character can have only one inspiration at a time.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"113\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Forgotten Realms</span></span> <p>Just like a fantasy novel or movie, an adventure is set in a larger world. In fact, the world can be anything that the DM and players can imagine. It could be a swords-and-sorcery setting at the dawn of civilization, where barbarians battle evil sorcerers, or a post-apocalyptic fantasy where elves and dwarves wield magic amid the wreckage of a technological civilization. Most D&amp;D settings are somewhere between those two extremes: worlds of medieval high fantasy with knights and castles, as well as elven cities, dwarven mines, and fearsome monsters.</p><p>The world of the Forgotten Realms is one such setting, and that's where the story in this adventure takes place. In the Realms, knights dare the crypts of the fallen dwarf kings of Delzoun, seeking glory and treasure. Rogues prowl the dark alleyways of teeming cities such as Neverwinter and Baldur's Gate. Clerics in the service of gods wield mace and spell, questing against the terrifying powers that threaten the land. Wizards plunder the ruins of the fallen Netherese empire, delving into secrets too dark for the light of day. Dragons, giants, demons, and unimaginable abominations lurk in dungeons, caverns, ruined cities, and the vast wild places of the world.</p><p>On the roads and rivers of the Realms travel minstrels and peddlers, merchants and guards, soldiers, sailors, and steel-hearted adventurers carrying tales of strange, glorious, faraway places. Good maps and clear trails can take even an inexperienced youth with dreams of glory far across the world. Thousands of restless would-be heroes from backcountry farmsteads and sleepy villages arrive in Neverwinter and the other great cities every year in search of wealth and renown.</p><p>Known roads may be well traveled, but they aren't necessarily safe. Fell magic, deadly monsters, and cruel local rulers are all perils that you face when you travel in the Forgotten Realms. Even farms and freeholds within a day's walk of a city can fall prey to monsters, and no place is safe from the sudden wrath of a dragon.</p><p>The regional map shows just a tiny part of this vast world, in a region called the Sword Coast. This is a region of adventure, where daring souls delve into the wreckage of ancient strongholds and explore ruins of long-lost cultures. Amid a wilderness of jagged, snow-capped peaks, alpine forests, lawlessness, and monsters, the coast holds the greatest bastions of civilization, including the coastal city of Neverwinter.</p><div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery\"><p></p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery-image\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/LMoP/The Sword Coast.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"The Sword Coast\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/LMoP/The Sword Coast.jpg\" />\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">The Sword Coast</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div></div><p></p><p></p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div class=\"rd__wrp-gallery-image\"><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/LMoP/The Sword Coast (Player).jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"The Sword Coast (Player)\">\n\t\t\t\t<img class=\"rd__image\" src=\"https://5e.tools/img/adventure/LMoP/The Sword Coast (Player).jpg\" />\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t</div><div class=\"rd__image-title\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rd__image-title-inner \">The Sword Coast (Player)</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div></div><p></p></div></div></div></div>","folder":"eLftZ2PrXJG6TlKO","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"h9Ix1v77jOO90FDx":3},"flags":{"srd5e":{"source":"LMoP"}},"_id":"Pycu47Voanf43UUe"}

They can't learn much more in Phandalin, so they need to set out into the forests and hills surrounding the town to uncover the larger plots they are caught up in. The characters are not required to visit all the locations in this section. Depending on which NPCs the characters met and which quests or clues they picked up, some or all the following information might be known to them:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">Sister Garaele wants the characters to seek out the banshee Agatha in the ruined town of Conybery and ask her about Bowgentle's spellbook.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Daran Edermath wants the characters to find out who is lurking near the ruins at Old Owl Well.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Quelline Alderleaf has suggested that the characters go to the ruined town of Thundertree and consult with the druid Reidoth, who might know the whereabouts of Cragmaw Castle, Wave Echo Cave, or both.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Townmaster Harbin Wester wants the characters to seek out an orc encampment near Wyvern Tor and chase the orcs away from the area.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Sildar Hallwinter wants the characters to find Cragmaw Castle, search for Gundren Rockseeker, rescue the dwarf, and retrieve his map.</li></ul><p>Each of these possible quests has its own section in this part of the adventure.

The area gains its name from an old trail that runs from the distant town of Triboar to the east, winding westward about one hundred miles through the abandoned village of Conyberry, then running north of Phandalin on its way to the High Road along the coast.</p><p>Describe the party's overland travels as vividly as you like, but keep the story moving. \"You walk for several miles and encounter nothing of interest\" is far less evocative and memorable than, \"A light rain dampens the rolling plains as you travel north.

The Triboar Trail runs right through the abandoned town, providing an easy landmark for locating the lair of the banshee Agatha. From the ruins of Conyberry, an old trail leads northwest into Neverwinter Wood. Agatha's lair is a few miles outside town.</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><p>The forest grows dark and still as the trail winds deeper into the trees. Heavy vines and thick layers of moss drape the branches, and the air is noticeably colder than it was in the ruined village. Rounding a bend in the trail, you see a screen made from the warped branches of trees standing close together, woven into a domelike shelter in the shadows. A low doorway leads inside.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>If the characters exercise caution and remember what they've come for, they will be able to speak with the banshee. When the characters enter the shelter, read the following:</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><p>A home of sorts is sheltered within the dome of woven branches.

A cold, pale light flickers in the air, rapidly taking on the form of a female elf, her hair and robes waving in a spectral wind. She might have been beautiful once, but a hateful expression twists her features now. \"Foolish mortals,\" she snarls. \"What do you want here? Do you not know it is death to seek me out?\"</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>If the characters are rude, disrespectful, or threatening, Agatha scowls and disappears.

The player whose character takes the lead in speaking with the banshee makes the check. If that player roleplays the encounter well, allow him or her to make the check with advantage. If any character has Sister Garaele's silver comb and presents it to Agatha as a gift, the check is automatically successful.</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><p>The ghostly figure smiles with cold amusement. \"Very well,\" she says. \"I know that you seek many things.

She does not know what became of the book afterward. Her answer is truthful, and it is all the information Sister Garaele needs for the Harpers to resume their search.</p><p>The characters might instead choose to ask Agatha about something else-for example, the location of Cragmaw Castle, the location of Wave Echo Cave, the identity of the Black Spider, or Hamun Kost's question about Old Owl Well (see that section). Agatha is well informed and a capable diviner, so she can answer almost any single question pertaining to the adventure that the characters think to ask.

In the tower's courtyard stands an old well that still delivers clean, fresh water. Old Owl Well lies in the wild and rugged hills south of the Triboar Trail. The site is relatively easy to find, and any NPC in Phandalin can provide directions to the ruins.</p><p>Recently, prospectors in the area have noted that someone has set up a campsite at Old Owl Well, and that undead guardians have been posted to keep intruders out.</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><p>As you crest a low ridge, you spy the crumbling ruins of an old watchtower standing amid the rugged hills. The place is so old that the walls are only mounds of rubble enclosing a courtyard of sorts, adjacent to the broken stump of an old tower. A colorful tent has been set up in the middle of the courtyard, but no one is in sight.</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>The ruins are currently occupied by a mage who is busy exploring the site in the hope of gleaning arcane lore left behind by its builders. The characters can enter the site from any direction, either following old footpaths or scrambling up the slope and finding a gap in the surrounding walls of rubble.</p><p>Twelve @Actor[I8yy9SWJdocyivbL]{zombies} lurk inside the crumbled shell of the old watchtower and can't be seen from outside. However, any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 10 or higher smells a deathly odor wafting from the tower's direction. When characters approach the tower or the tent, the zombies shamble out of the tower.</p><p>If a battle erupts, Hamun Kost, the @Actor[PrJfUYDMASTF0GuV]{evil mage}, emerges from his tent and asks,</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset \"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"267\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Red-Robed Mage</span></span><p>\"What is the meaning of this?\"</p><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div><p>Kost is a stout, red-robed figure with sallow skin, a shaved scalp, and a black tattoo on his forehead. A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check recognizes Kost's tattoo as a necromantic symbol.

Once, this was a prosperous community on the outskirts of the forest, wealthy from the work of its woodcutters and trappers. Then thirty years ago, the eruption of Mount Hotenow to the north devastated Thundertree. In the wake of the natural disaster, a plague of strange zombies swept over the area, killing or driving off those who survived the eruption.</p><p>Though most of the zombies have long since crumbled to dust, strange magic permeating the area has mutated the local vegetation into new and dangerous forms. Few people dare to venture into the ruined village now, and those who do so seldom stay long-with two notable exceptions. The druid Reidoth (see area 4) visits Thundertree from time to time, keeping a wary eye on its dangers. Cultists have also arrived recently (see area 13) to treat with a dragon that claims Thundertree as its domain (see area 7).</p><p>As the party approaches the ruins, read the following:</p><div class=\"rd__b-inset rd__b-inset--readaloud \"><p>Gradually, the trail becomes an old, overgrown lane winding between dilapidated buildings choked in vines and brush.

However, he is currently most concerned by the fact that a green dragon has moved into the tower (area 7) since the last time he was here.

Though the wyverns never returned, other creatures lair here from time to time. Wyvern Tor's current squatters include a band of orcs and their ogre ally.</p><p>The orcs are scouts of the Many Arrows tribe. These orcs often roam into the more civilized areas of the North, spying out human settlements, waylaying travelers, and looting and plundering as opportunities present themselves. Stories of new settlers near Phandalin and renewed traffic along the old Triboar Trail drew this band to the area.

The goblins also shout loudly enough to alert their comrades in areas 4 and 6 that the castle is under attack.</p><p><b>Disguised Characters</b></p><p>Rather than storm Cragmaw Castle with weapons in hand, clever characters might try to talk their way inside. For example, they might don the scarlet cloaks of the Redbrands and claim to be emissaries sent by Iarno \"Glasstaff\" Albrek, the Redbrand leader, to meet with King Grol. A good DM rewards this kind of clever thinking by giving the characters a chance to succeed.</p><p>It's okay if the characters circumvent combat and talk their way past castle defenders. Both the Cragmaw tribe and the Redbrands work for the Black Spider, so the goblinoids aren't likely to attack the party if they claim to be working in the Black Spider's interest.</p><p>If the characters try to perpetrate a deception as a group, have them each make a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the monsters' Wisdom (Insight) checks, and give the characters advantage on their checks if the deception is particularly well planned or roleplayed. If at least one of the characters win the contest, the deception is a success.
